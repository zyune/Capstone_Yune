## 1. Monitoring Coastal Changes and Erosion
Objective: Analyze coastal changes and erosion over time along Maine's coastline.

Data: Use Landsat imagery to monitor changes in coastline position, beach erosion, and land cover changes.

Method: Perform time series analysis on historical data to identify trends and significant changes. Use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to study changes in coastal vegetation.

Outcome: Provide insights into erosion patterns, impacts on local communities, and recommendations for coastal management.

## 2. Mapping and Analyzing Urban Growth
Objective: Study urban expansion in cities like Portland and Bangor.

Data: Use Landsat imagery to map urban areas and track changes over several decades.

Method: Classify land cover types and use change detection techniques to quantify urban growth.

Outcome: Understand urban sprawl patterns, their environmental impact, and inform urban planning efforts.
## 3. Forest Health and Management
Objective: Assess the health and changes in Maine’s forests.

Data: Utilize Landsat's NIR and SWIR bands to monitor forest cover, health, and biomass.

Method: Calculate NDVI and other vegetation indices to detect changes in forest health. Analyze the impact of logging, diseases, and climate change.

Outcome: Provide valuable data for forest management, conservation strategies, and policy-making.
## 4. Water Quality Monitoring
Objective: Monitor water quality in Maine’s lakes and rivers.

Data: Use Landsat imagery to detect changes in water bodies.

Method: Apply water quality indices such as NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and turbidity analysis.

Outcome: Identify trends in water quality, detect pollution events, and support water management policies.
## 5. Impact of Climate Change on Snow Cover
Objective: Study the changes in snow cover and its impact on Maine’s environment.

Data: Analyze Landsat data to monitor seasonal snow cover changes.

Method: Use NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) to map and quantify snow cover extent and duration.

Outcome: Provide insights into climate change effects on snow cover, influencing water resources and winter tourism.
## 6. Flood Risk Assessment and Management
Objective: Assess flood risk and monitor historical flood events in Maine.

Data: Utilize historical Landsat imagery to identify flood-prone areas.

Method: Perform flood mapping using spectral indices and change detection during known flood events.

Outcome: Develop flood risk maps, support disaster preparedness and response plans.`
